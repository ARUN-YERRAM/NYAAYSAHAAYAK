        Property law is a branch of civil law that governs the various forms of ownership and possession of real and personal property. It encompasses a wide range of legal principles and rules that dictate how individuals and entities can acquire, use, transfer, and protect their property rights. Real property refers to land and anything permanently attached to it, while personal property includes movable assets like cars and furniture.

The transfer of property ownership involves a meticulously structured process commencing with negotiations between the seller and buyer, culminating in a comprehensive agreement. A pivotal step is the drafting of a purchase agreement delineating terms, including the property's legal description, purchase price, contingencies, and the closing date. Subsequently, a thorough title search is conducted to verify ownership and identify any encumbrances. The transaction is often facilitated through escrow, with the buyer providing earnest money as a gesture of commitment. The heart of the transfer lies in the execution of a deed—an official document signed, dated, and notarized—effectuating the legal transfer of ownership. The culmination occurs during the closing, where the buyer pays the remaining purchase price, and the deed is delivered, signed, and recorded in public records. This meticulous process ensures a transparent and legally sound transfer of property, providing clarity in ownership rights and obligations.
