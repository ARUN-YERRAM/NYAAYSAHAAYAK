        Civil laws are a branch of legal systems that primarily deal with private disputes between individuals or entities. These laws aim to resolve conflicts and provide remedies for those who have suffered harm, rather than punishing wrongdoers as in criminal law. Civil laws cover a broad spectrum of issues, including contracts, property disputes, family matters, personal injury, and torts.

        One of the fundamental principles of civil law is the concept of compensation or restitution, where the party found liable is often required to compensate the aggrieved party for their losses. The burden of proof in civil cases is typically lower than in criminal cases, with the standard being a preponderance of evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Civil laws vary widely across jurisdictions, reflecting cultural, historical, and legal differences. In some legal systems, such as those based on Roman law, civil law is codified, meaning that laws are written down in comprehensive statutes. In contrast, common law systems rely more on precedent and judicial decisions.

        Civil litigation involves the process of bringing a lawsuit to court, with parties presenting evidence and arguments to support their claims. Courts may award damages, issue injunctions, or declare legal rights in civil cases. Mediation and arbitration are also common methods of resolving civil disputes outside the courtroom.
